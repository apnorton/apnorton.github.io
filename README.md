# apnorton.github.io
My personal website.  I aim for this to be a way of advertising my projects, as well as an opportunity for me to get used to some front-end tools.  (I've mainly done back-end stuff.)  I'll also use this site as a way of sharing helper code and files for TAs and other students.

##To do/project goals:
  - Create a dedicated "about me" page
  - Create resume page
  - A blog (perhaps no longer host on blogger)

## Things to investigate:
  - The top-bar hides content when linked... perhaps make the nav bar fixed at top instead floating
  - Can I use Django stuff on Github, or must I host it separately?
